Paperless One was created as a comprehensive dashboard and report generator to integrate seamlessly with all operations of the Paperless Instore Selling team. Currently, Paperless One acts as a dashboard to display statistics of all kinds of tickets and generate reports of them on-need or scheduled as emails*.


Since the system is in Beta, we request you to let us know any defects found while using the system so we can fix it. Thank you!
